            Parties arranged by CITS are full of fun. CITS in past few semesters, arranged number of welcome parties for new students. 
            As this is the first social event as well as interactive session for new students with their batch mates so CITS take it as 
            pride to arrange such interactive things for fresher. <br>
            As this is the first event of CITS for new students so this is task which create the image of society in the mind of new 
            students. That's why this is also responsibility of CITS to manage its repute among new students and also provide student with 
            memorable night. <br>
            As far as whole activities which took place on welcome night is concerned, number of different fun activities combined with 
            the help of different societies are took place to make that night memorable. <br>
            Activities mostly starts with the speech of our well-known teachers of CS department of COMSATS which motivates new students 
            as well as try to teach some basic lessons of university life. <br>
            Moving towards, music is one of the prominent part of this eve. Number of local bands including bands from CMS 
            (COMSATS MUSIC SOCOETY) as well as some bands from other universities performed which convert that night into melodious one.
            After bands performance some local boys of COMSATS also perform individually as well as in combination with their partners. 
            Selections of these performances are done by the EC of CITS so only well talented singers are allowed to showcase their talent 
            in front of juniors. <br>
            As this night is not all about music so there are a lot of activities which made the night more exciting. Mimicry always 
            pleased everyone. So luckily COMSATS also have some mimicry artist which try their best to spread laughter. Mimicry session 
            is not as such long but the performance of 5 to 7 minutes are always the source of smile that night. <br>
            Moving towards something more exciting, Dance. There are few group dance performances are also the part of that eve. Dances 
            like Attan, Hip Hop, Bhangra are source of enjoyment for students.Energetic Dance performances on Cultural as well as on Party 
            songs boost everyone's feet to try to dance along with group on the rhythmic songs. <br>
            Some other activities are there to involve students in more better way. Competions like Mr and Misses EVE, some fun activities 
            like 30 sec to 60 sec small tasks (Bottle flip challenge, Drink it first etc) are also there for students in which they 
            challenged each other and win different prizes. <br>
            Now moving towards the Food. Evening dinner is also the part of Welcome where CITS try to serve best available menu with good 
            taste to everyone. CITS always try not to compromise on the quality of food that's why every single time there is live cooking 
            arranged. Aroma of spices are always a mouth watering part of eve. <br>
