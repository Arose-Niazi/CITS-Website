					</div>
					<!--A 3-->
					<div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
						<div class="card-body">
							Pesticides are chemicals that are tactically applied to organic and conventional crops in order to protect them from insects, rodents, weeds and types of fungal growths. The use of pesticides must be documented by farmers and is regulated by several government agencies worldwide
							</br>
							A member label may not say what you are not allowed to do with it. Labels usually only list how you are allowed to use the member.

					</div>
					<!--A 4-->
					<div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
						<div class="card-body">
							By keeping pests and weeds at bay, the use of pesticides helps farmers to produce high-quality fruits and vegetables quicker and with greater yields. Pesticides also increase the shelf life of several crops because they help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew that can increase spoilage. This reduces the cost of your favorite fruits and vegetables and can make them safer to eat.

							The breakdown of A chemical is measured by its half-life. Each ingredient will move differently in the environment. Pesticide ingredients vary in their potential to dissolve, vaporize, bind to soils, or enter groundwater.

						</a>
					</div>
					<div id="collapseseven" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
						<div class="card-body">
							Some fruits and vegetables do have minute amounts of pesticide residues present on them. Pesticides can remain on food for A short time. Over time, exposure to oxygen and sunlight will cause the residues to break down and dissipate. By the time the food gets to you, there is little-to-no residue left. Crops are constantly tested to make sure the residues are low and that the food that reaches us is safe.

						</a>
					</div>
					<div id="collapseeight" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
						<div class="card-body">
							While farmers do not douse their crops with pesticides, over the years, farmers have developed A technique known as IPM which combines the use of physical, biological, and chemical pest controls. This allows farmers to use fewer pesticides and maintain reliable crop yieldsâ€”this is profitable for the farmer but is also better for the environment.
