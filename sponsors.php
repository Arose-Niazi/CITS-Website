                    <p>Leisure Leagues is one of the permanent proud partner of CITS from last 2 years. Futsal event, which is organized by 
                    CITS every student week is sponsored by Leisure League. Leisure League family and CITS work hand in hand in order to 
                    promote football activities within COMSATS. Here is the short introduction of Leisure League.<br>
                    Leisure Leagues, which is the world’s largest organizer of small sided football leagues brought the International 
                    Football scenario to Pakistan back in July 2017. It was undoubtedly a courageous yet firm step taken by Leisure Leagues 
                    Pakistan when Ronaldinho along with 6 other football legends came to Pakistan.   <br>
                    Leisure Leagues Pakistan took a monumental step in 2018 by organizing the first ever National Football Championship. 
                    Later the same year the National Champions were taken to Lisbon, Portugal to participate in the International Socca 
                    Football World Cup which was the very first of its kind in the 70-year history of Pakistan. Our National football 
                    team competed against European giants like Spain, France, Russia, Germany and so on.  <br>
                    The journey and football network grew further as Leisure Leagues expanded from 8 to 77 cities across Pakistan and 
                    regular football leagues were organized from the towns of Hunza to the coasts of Gawadar. Leisure Leagues organized 
                    its “Second National Football Championship” on 28 July, 2019 where over 70 teams representing more than 70 cities across 
                    Pakistan competed. Lahore team subsequently became the National Champions of Pakistan and represented Pakistan this 
                    October at Second International Socca World Cup which took place in  Crete , Greece.<br>
                    Leisure Leagues has been working closely with many educational institutes for development of football by organizing 
                    fitness clinics workshops and coaching sessions designed exclusively for easily grasping the essentials of the sport.<br>

                    <p>As far as major revenue of our events are concerned like winning prices of our events and other expenditures 
                    which are required for smooth and good management of events are provided by COMSATS. So it’s quite wrong if we not 
                    mentioned over university as our Partner.<br>
                        Every student week societies pitch their required budget to COMSATS management and university issue a certain 
                        amount to societies depending on the reach and expenditures of events. Similar is the case with CITS. We pitch our 
                        events in the form of Geekspree/ CITE and university provide us funds so that we will manage a good source of 
                        entertainment for other students.<br>
                        It’s almost impossible to organize events without the help and support of university. So COMSATS at the time of 
                        events is more proud partner to CITS than that of a university management.<br><br>
